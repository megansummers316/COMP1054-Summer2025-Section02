/* Styling Tables */
/* 

- important to understand how to make use of pseudocasses to style their states effectively 
- important to know how to style links for use in common interface features whose content varies, suchs as navigation menus and tables */



/* Link States
- links can exist in different states & can be styled uing different pseudo-classes 

Link: A link that has a destination (i.e., not just a named anchor), styled using the :link pseudo class.

Visited: A link that has already been visited (exists in the browser's history), styled using the :visited pseudo class.

Hover: A link that is hovered over by a user's mouse pointer, styled using the :hover pseudo class.

Focus: A link that is focused (e.g., moved to by a keyboard user using the Tab key or something similar, or programmatically focused using HTMLElement.focus()) â€” this is styled using the :focus pseudo class.

Active: A link that is activated (e.g., clicked on), styled using the :active pseudo class.

/* Default Styles 

- links are underlined
- unvisited links are blue
- visited links are purple 
- hovering a link makes the mouse pointer change to a little hand icon 
- focused links have an outline around them - you can focus on links by presseding the tab key (on MAc option + tab) 
- active links are red (try holding down the mouse button on the link as you click on it 
- default styles are nearly the same as the early days of the browsers - mid 1990's 
- users have come to know and expect this behaviour - we need to make syre links still look and act like links
- at minimum - use underlinging for links, but not for other things (if you don't want to underline, at least highlight in some way) 
- make links react in same way when hovered/focused and in a slightly different way when activitated 
- default styles can be turned off/changed using - color, cursor, outline 

*/

/* Adding Custom Styles to Links  */
/* the order is important because link styles build on another (the styles in the first one will apply to all the subsqeuent ones, when a link is actviated, it is also hovered) 
- if you put it in a different order and you're changing the same properties in each ruleset, things won't work as expected 
To remember the order, you could try using a mnemonic like LoVe Fears HAte.
